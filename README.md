# Chicago Crime Analysis and Forecaster
Data life-cycle project using Chicago crime data to better understand crime trends in the city and to predict future crime rates for 2019. Conducted for SNHU Data Analytics capstone project.

## Goals
```
- Identify outliers and trends within Chicago's crime data through eda
- Map out crime rates by area of city (ward)
- Identify peak hours for Chicago crime to occur.
- Model time-series of hourly crime rates to create forecaster
- Create visuals which impart time-series and hourly trends in crime. 
- Form a final report and presentation to impart Business Value of project to stakeholders
```

## Business Questions
```
- Can hourly crime rates be accurately predicted?
- Are there any temporal trends in the data? 
- Can predictions be split by neighborhood to specifically identify resource needs?
```

## Hypothesis

- Crime rates can be estimated based upon time of hour and day of week..
- There is a downward trend (excluding seasonality and cycle) in overall annual crime rates.
- Certain hours are more likely to have higher rates of crime than others.
- Some neighborhoods have higher variability in crime rates than others.
