# Chicago Crime Analysis and Forecaster
Data life-cycle project using Chicago crime data to better understand crime trends in the city and to predict future crime rates for 2019. Conducted for SNHU Data Analytics capstone project.

## Goals
```
- Identify outliers and trends within Chicago's crime data through eda
- Map out crime rates by area of city 
- Model time-series of daily crime rates to create forecaster
- Increase accuracy of this forecaster by incorporating external data
- Create visuals which impart time-series and other crime trends
- Form a final report and presentation to impart Business Value of project to stakeholders
```

## Business Questions
```
- Can daily crime rates be accurately predicted?
- Are there any specific temporal trends to Chicago crime rates?
- Does weather have any influence on crime rates?
AND given more time:
- Can predictions be split by neighborhood to specifically identify resource needs?
```

## Hypothesis
```
- Crime rates can be estimated based upon time of year and day of week.
- There is a downward trend (excluding seasonality and cycle) in overall annual crime rates.
- Temperature has a positive correlation with crime rates.
AND given more time:
- Some neighborhoods have higher variability in crime rates than others.

## Loading Data
```
(1) Connect to crime data set
	|--> Data located at www.cityofchicago.org
	|--> To load data through bat file, request API credentials
	|--> Set API credentials into env variables
